this is the `reference` code site for me (jekyll)[https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise].and the site is [this](bundle exec jekyll serve)
in my terminal
```
$ git clone https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise.git
$ cd jekyll-klise
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
we see the site running at port  no 4000
then i made a repo with the github username,and setup git using [this](https://dev.to/shafia/support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal-access-token-instead-4nbk)
then i pushed the code and the site is live
to personalize it go to posts folder and make a folder inside it create a markdown file with the present date and with name like this
