## terms and conditions
- here the description is
- ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/2df325df-8850-4309-9213-325bf57d10dc)
- this is how the endpoint is
- ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/f833eef7-2e19-413b-9b14-fe2f8a4d3551)
- when we try to place our cursor on it it moves
- so there is frontend scirpt which stops us
- so try it in mobile
- there is a condition to stop touching as well
- ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/eeb99f3b-2f24-4d50-b444-133fcb854037)
- then we see there is no form to submit as well
- so the element is getted by id by the server and the corresponding function to get the flag is called
- ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/3e207ba1-a1bd-483a-9c2b-d67a09ea1f46)
- we dont even have access to the function either
- but we can get the element by id and try to click it
- ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/2dd3f5e8-c200-4821-8582-655bd77b7463)
- so the flag is lactf{that_button_was_definitely_not_one_of_the_terms}
- document get element by id https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_getelementbyid.asp

- now we use ghidra to analyse the code
- we see the main funciton
- ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/8ccc22ff-fb79-4755-8d37-288cb5f21285)
- here we see case 5 is the win
- ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/07370113-6160-4a5d-abda-2b8cf5a578ec)
- we see the flag but not in order
- so we order them and get the flag
- ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/f4e1f061-7935-4517-b5cc-72a0fc3339d7)

- given cipher text is like this
- ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/94aeba41-c21f-4c5c-9781-08c3fd194040)
-  and this is the first line of the decoded part as given
-  ![image](https://github.com/m0wn1ka/ctf_writeups/assets/127676379/7491ba53-2c14-4838-9184-75638ccf064e)
- veniger cipher is like  ceaser cipher but for each letter it  has different move for the lenght of the key
- here the as part of hint it was told the key length is 161
- so for each 161 chars of the cipher text the key will be repeated
- so as in the given cipher text we do see the flage but it is encrypted (can be found by {} as these are not encrypted)
- the veniger cipher only encryptes alphabets and not special symbols and numbers
- so we divide the cipher text such that we remove all non alphbet chars
- then we splice the string to reach the flag i.e [:161] then [161:161*2] like this
- we get the part where the flag lies
### part1 of code

for i in cipher:
    if i.isalpha():

````
- now we go to part2 of solving
- now the last part has just 44 chars 
- in p we store the plain text relvent length
- in c we store the corresponding cipher text of the same length
- we convert both of them to lower chars
- in x we store what should be decrypted
```
#c=p+k
#k=c-p
#p=c-k
```
- as this is the rule we find the keys
- then using cyclic manner we get the x decrypted by the same rules
### part2 code

- we remove the whitespacces

- we rearrange the underscores and get the flag

- so by analyzing the code we see
- that there must be a stirng pretty and please in the input
- it compares the user input string and counts the occurences and adds the occurences
- `pretty` count is in ivar5 and `please` count is in ivar4
- then it checks whetehr user input has the word flag
- if flag word does not exist it sasy sorry i did not understand and returns
- so we must have flag as well in our input
- then it checks whether the count of ivar5,ivar4 for a few conditions
- their sum must be 0x36 and their diff must be 0x16
- then it gives the flag
### conditions analysis
```
x+y=54
x-y=-24
=====
y=x+24
y=54-x
========
x+24=54-x
2x=30
x=15
======
x+y=54
y=54-15
y=39,x=15
var5=x=pretty=15
var4=y=please=39
```
### python to generate user input
```
>>> int('0x36',16)
54
>>> int('0x18',16)
24
>>> 54015
54015
>>> 54-5
49
>>> 54-15
39
>>> ans='pretty'*15+'please'*39
>>> ans
'prettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettyprettypleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease'
>>> 
```
- so now we give this input and append the word flag as it is required (a check satisfaction)
