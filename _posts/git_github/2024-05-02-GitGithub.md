- make a hash and check the file changed or not
- repo,current working dir
- Branch: A branch is a named series of linked commits. The most recent commit on a branch is called the head
-  The default branch, which is created when you initialize a repository, is called main, often named master in Git. The head of the current branch is named HEAD
- Remote: A remote is a named reference to another Git repository. When you create a repo, Git creates a remote named origin that is the default remote for push and pull operations.
