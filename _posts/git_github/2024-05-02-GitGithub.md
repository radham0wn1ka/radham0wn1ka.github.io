- Git is a distributed version control system
- It provides a way to work with one or more local branches and then push them to a remote repository.
- GitHub is a cloud platform that uses Git as its core technology. GitHub simplifies the process of collaborating on projects and provides a website, more command-line tools, and overall flow that developers and users can use to work together. GitHub act s as the remote repository
- Key features provided by GitHub include:


    Issues
    Discussions
    Pull requests
    Notifications
    Labels
    Actions
    Forks
    Projects

- Git is distributed, which means that a project's complete history is stored both on the client and on the server. You can edit files without a network connection, check them in locally, and sync with the server when a connection becomes available
- make a hash and check the file changed or not
- repo,current working dir
- Branch: A branch is a named series of linked commits. The most recent commit on a branch is called the head
-  The default branch, which is created when you initialize a repository, is called main, often named master in Git. The head of the current branch is named HEAD
- Remote: A remote is a named reference to another Git repository. When you create a repo, Git creates a remote named origin that is the default remote for push and pull operations.
- commands sub commands :git pull

## git using
-  We tell Git to start tracking changes by initializing a Git repository into that folder.
### sample
```
C:\home\radha\Music\portfolio\jekyll-klise> git status   
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        _posts/git_github/
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)            
C:\home\radha\Music\portfolio\jekyll-klise> git add .   
C:\home\radha\Music\portfolio\jekyll-klise> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   _posts/git_github/2024-05-02-GitGithub.md           
C:\home\radha\Music\portfolio\jekyll-klise> git commit -m "c2"     
[main 0df674e] c2
 1 file changed, 30 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 _posts/git_github/2024-05-02-GitGithub.md         
C:\home\radha\Music\portfolio\jekyll-klise> git status        
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working tree clean        
C:\home\radha\Music\portfolio\jekyll-klise> 
```
- git add is the command you use to tell Git to start keeping track of changes in certain files.
- The technical term is staging these changes. You'll use git add to stage changes to prepare for a commit. All changes in files that have been added but not yet committed are stored in the staging area
- After you've staged some changes for commit, you can save your work to a snapshot by invoking the git commit command.
- The data that's saved in a commit includes the author's name and e-mail address, the date, comments about what you did (and why), an optional digital signature, and the unique identifier of the preceding commit.

- Git is a fast distributed revision control system.
- single Git repository can track development on multiple branches. It does this by keeping a list of heads which reference the latest commit on each branch
### git tagging
```
C:\home\radha\todo_list> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	todo.csv
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
C:\home\radha\todo_list> git tag
v1
C:\home\radha\todo_list> git add .
C:\home\radha\todo_list> git commit -m "commit after adding todo.csv"
[main 97b152c] commit after adding todo.csv
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 todo.csv
C:\home\radha\todo_list> git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working tree clean
C:\home\radha\todo_list> git tag
v1
C:\home\radha\todo_list> git branch
* main
C:\home\radha\todo_list> git switch -c b1 v1
Switched to a new branch 'b1'
C:\home\radha\todo_list> git branch
* b1
  main
C:\home\radha\todo_list> 
```
- git switch
- git switch -c is for creating new branch
`git switch [<options>] (-c|-C) <new-branch> [<start-point>]`
- git switch branch_name_to_switch
- git branch new_barnch_name starging_point
- git checkout  -b new_branch_nae starting_point 
- git branch <branch> <start-point>
    create a new branch named <branch>, referencing <start-point>, which may be specified any way you like, including using a branch name or a tag name.
 - git switch 
 - The git switch command normally expects a branch head, but will also accept an arbitrary commit when invoked with --detach; for example, you can check out the commit referenced by a tag
 - swithc to a specifi commit without cretign a new branch for that
 `git switch --detach c`

- git reset branch_name
- from a remote branch to create a local branch we use  `git switch -c my_local_new_branch origin/exiiting_branch`
- "origin" is just the name that Git uses by default to refer to the repository that you cloned from
```
Branches, remote-tracking branches, and tags are all references to commits. All references are named with a slash-separated path name starting with refs; the names weâ€™ve been using so far are actually shorthand:
    The branch test is short for refs/heads/test.
    The tag v2.6.18 is short for refs/tags/v2.6.18.
    origin/master is short for refs/remotes/origin/master
```
### git remote add origin
```
The git remote add command takes two arguments:
    A remote name, for example, origin
    A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
# Set a new remote
$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```
### git remote set-url
- The git remote set-url command changes an existing remote repository URL.
```
The git remote set-url command takes two arguments:
    An existing remote name. For example, origin or upstream are two common choices.
$ git remote -v
> origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
Use the git remote rename command to rename an existing remote.
The git remote rename command takes two arguments:
    An existing remote name, for example, origin
    A new name for the remote, for example, destinat
```
### git remote rm
```
$ git remote -v
# View current remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
$ git remote rm destination
# Remove remote
$ git remote -v
# Verify it's gone
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
Note: git remote rm does not delete the remote repository from the server. It simply removes the remote and its references from your local repository.
```

### fetch -merge
```
These commands are very useful when interacting with a remote repository. clone and fetch download remote code from a repository's remote URL to your local computer, merge is used to merge different people's work together with yours, and pull is a combination of fetch and merge
```
### git clone
```
When you run git clone, the following actions occur:
    A new folder called repo is made
    It is initialized as a Git repository
    A remote named origin is created, pointing to the URL you cloned from
    All of the repository's files and commits are downloaded there
    The default branch is checked out
```
- git fetch origin :to fetch the origin content
- get merge main(the branch with what we want to merge the remote) origin/main(it is origin`/`main only )
- by these all files in the local which are not in remote are as well preserverd and new files which are in remote but not in local are downloaded
- but when coming to the point of modifications the remote repos modifications of a file will take precedence
### git pull
- to do the same(fetch and merge) in git pull for divergetn branches it says a lot
```
\home\radha\todo_list> git pull origin main
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 936 bytes | 936.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/m0wn1ka/todo_list_private
 branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
   ee1b46a..5c8d7f6  main       -> origin/main
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.

## git switch
- The git switch command was introduced in Git 2.23 as a way to split and clarify the two different uses of git checkout: switching branches and restoring files. The idea behind this move is to let people use git switch for switching branches and git restore for undoing changes from a commit.
- git switch <branch>
- This command will change your current branch to the one specified by <branch>. If the branch does not exist locally, it will try to find it on the remote repository and create a local copy
- Create a new branch and switch to it  git switch -c feature2
- Switch to a specific commit without creating a new branch git switch --detach 1234567
- Merge current branch into master before switching to it git switch -m master
- Force-switch to another branch and discard any uncommitted changes  git switch -f feature3
- git switch [<options>] (-c|-C) <new-branch> [<start-point>] :create new one and checkout
- You can also use git stash to save your changes temporarily and restore them later
## git branch
- git branch hello-world-images create new one
- git branch :list
ex
```
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/.../linux-2.6 my2.6(folder into which to lone)
$ cd my2.6
$ git branch my2.6.14(branch name to create) v2.6.14( name of the tag or commit from which the new branch )   (1)
$ git switch my2.6.14
```
## git checkout
-  used to navigate between branches, restore files, create new branches, and update submodules
- switch to an existing branch:git checkout <branch> 
- create a new branch based on current branch:git checkout -b feature2
- reate or reset a branch and switch to it(f you want to create or reset a branch called feature3 based on master and switch to it):git checkout -B feature3 master
- Create a new branch that tracks a remote branch and switch to it(If you want to create a new branch that tracks a remote branch called feature4 and switch to it):git checkout -t feature4
## git guide
- https://github.com/git-guides/git-remote
## git pull 
- rebase
- before
```
Local main branch:       A - B
Remote origin/main:      C - D
```
-after
```
Local main branch:       C - D - A' - B'
Remote origin/main:      C - D
```
- 1. Reset and Pull
- If you are sure you want to discard your local changes and match the remote branch exactly, you can use a combination of git fetch and git reset --hard
```
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```
- 2. Stash and Pull
- If you want to temporarily save your local changes, pull the latest changes, and then reapply your local changes, you can use git stash:
```
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
```
## git reset
```
Undo A git pull
To effectively "undo" a git pull, you cannot undo the git fetch â€“ but you can undo the git merge that changed your local working branch.
To do this, you will need to git reset to the commit you made before you merged. You can find this commit by searching the git reflog. The reflog is a log of every place that HEAD has pointed â€“ every place that you have ever been checked out to. This reflog is only kept for 30 to 90 days, depending on the commit, and is only stored locally. (The reflog is a great reason not to delete a repository if you think you've made a mistake!)
Run git reflog and search for the commit that you would like to return to. Then, run git reset --hard <SHA> to reset HEAD and your current branch to the SHA of the commit from before the merge.
Force git pull to Overwrite Local Files
If you have made commits locally that you regret, you may want your local branch to match the remote branch without saving any of your work. This can be done using git reset. First, make sure you have the most recent copy of that remote tracking branch by fetching.
git fetch <remote> <branch>
ex: git fetch origin main
Then, use git reset --hard to move the HEAD pointer and the current branch pointer to the most recent commit as it exists on that remote tracking branch.
git reset --hard <remote>/<branch>
ex: git reset --hard origin/main
```
